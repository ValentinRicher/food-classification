#  Food classification

Personal project for image classification on Food-101 dataset.  
This project has 2 goals :
- Optimize training time with TF Profiler -> DONE. I divided by 3 training times.
- Get best performance on Food-101 dataset using transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques based on papers in references.txt. -> IN PROGRESS.
- Intelligibility of the decisions taken by the algorithm. -> TODO.

# Setup 

Create a virtual environment and install librairies in `requirements.txt`

# Organization of the project

# Benchmark
